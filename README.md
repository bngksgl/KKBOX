# KKBOX

For Data Mining 1 project, we analysed the KKBOX dataset from Kaggle Competition in order to predict customer churn (https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge).  

KKBOX is a subscription-based music streaming service which operates in the Asia Market. Our project is to assist KKBOX by predicting customer churn as accurately as possible, as a part of Kaggle challenge. The main goal is to compare the evaluation metrics of the various classification algorithms, suggest the most suitable classifier(s) for the task and provide management advice based on the results. To do so, various classification techniques are applied on a pre-processed training dataset and an unadulterated test data set.  

The project consists of: 1- Preprocessing (Data Cleaning & Preparation, Variable Transformation & Sampling, Feature Subset Selection) 2- Data Mining (K Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Nearest Centroid, Support Vector Machine)
